## What is HumanDate?

HumanDate Core provides simple and intuitive utilities for turning **human-written dates** into `LocalDate` values — and back.

- No cryptic date patterns
- No ceremony
- Minimizes cognitive load
- Helps your UI speak the way users do

> If a human would understand the date, HumanDate should too.

## Key principles

- **Human-first** design
- **Predictable** behavior
- **Locale-aware** (starting with Spanish and English)
- **Dependency-free**, targeting **JDK 17**
- Ideal for **forms**, **CLIs**, and **business apps**

This repository contains the **core parsing & formatting APIs** only.  
UI integrations (JavaFX, etc.) will live in their own modules.
